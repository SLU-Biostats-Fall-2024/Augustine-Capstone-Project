## Data exploration feedback

1.  Line 24 - you are actually changing from character to factor

2.  I'd like to know more about why you decided to omit the values \> 1000 for transpiration_rate (you and I discussed this in class, and you reasons are sound, but I don't see them well-described in the .qmd file). Work on providing a more specific narration in your scientific thinking portion of the .qmd file.

3.  I'd like to see some histograms of your data for visual inspection of the quantitative variables and some sort of plots to help you get a sense of what portion of your data belong to each of the different factor levels in your C02_treatment and N_treatment variables.

Otherwise quite good!
